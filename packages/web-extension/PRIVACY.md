# Privacy policy for Taaabs browser extension

Effective Date: 24 Nov 2024

This Privacy Policy describes Taaabs's commitment to unmatched user privacy by employing zero-knowledge practices.

## 1. Our core privacy principles

- **No ads:** We are committed to providing a clean and ad-free experience.
- **No trackers:** The Taaabs extension does not track your browsing activity or its own usage. **Your privacy is paramount.**
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Links saved to your personal library are protected with **state-of-the-art end-to-end encryption**, ensuring that **only you can access them**.

## 2. Information we collect

The extension does not collect information of any kind. AI features are provided 100% locally. Once you sign in, bookmarks you create are stored remotely in an end-to-end encrypted manner (read more in point 4 Auth data below).

## 3. Privacy considerations

- **Webpage content:** The extension processes text of websites or screenshots in a vision mode **100% locally**.
- **AI communication:** The Extension facilitates communication with your chosen AI assistant via browser's built-in channels.
- **Bookmarks:** Plain text URLs, titles are never sent to Taaabs.

## 4. Auth data

If you decide to sign in, the extension uses your locally stored access token and encryption key in the following ways:

- **Checking if a given link is already saved:** To provide the functionality of checking if the current URL is already saved in your library, the extension generates a cryptographically secure hash (SHA256) of the URL (salted with encryption key). **This technique allows to check for a match with a remote server without ever sharing the actual URL.**

- **Creating bookmarks:** When you save a link, it's encrypted locally using your encryption key and only then sent to taaabs.com for storage. We only receive and store encrypted data of your bookmarks, **we cannot access their readable form**.

## 5. How we share your information

_(Applies to signed in users.)_ Your personal information (email address) is not shared with any third parties, unless legally required to do so.

## 6. Data security

_(Applies to signed in users.)_ We take data security very seriously. Your private bookmarks are **end-to-end encrypted** using **AES-CBC 256-bit encryption and Argon2id key derivation**, following battle-tested implementation in Bitwardenâ„¢ Password Manager. This ensures that **only you can decrypt and access your saved links**. While we use robust encryption, please remember that the security of your data also depends on the security of your own browser and system. We cannot control vulnerabilities or compromises of your browser or operating system.

Taaabs is committed to transparency. **The source code for the browser extension is open-source**, published under the [AGPLv3](https://github.com/taaabs/taaabs/blob/master/packages/web-extension/LICENSE) license at [GitHub](https://github.com/taaabs/taaabs/tree/master/packages/web-extension). We encourage community review and contributions. We also share source code of all the other web and mobile apps supporting your Taaabs experience.

## 7. Your choices

- **Sign in:** You can choose whether or not to sign in. Signing in enables the saving of encrypted bookmarks to your personal library.
- **Data deletion:** You can delete your locally stored access token and encryption key at any time by signing out of in extension's Settings page. You can also delete your taaabs.com account through the web interface at any time.

## 8. Children's privacy

Taaabs is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.

## 9. Changes to this privacy policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. We will post the revised Privacy Policy here and encourage you to review it regularly. Any changes are effective upon posting. We are committed to maintaining our zero-knowledge practices and pledge never to change them in any update to this policy.
