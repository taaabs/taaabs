    Does mymind save the entire text from articles and websites so I can use a
    full text search?
  </h2>
  <p>
    We currently do not index the entire text of websites saved to your mind.
    <strong>There are two reasons for it in case you are curious:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    1. <strong>Performance</strong>: Eventually your search will become too
    slow, because we'd index millions and millions of words and text from
    websites and articles. Often the majority of words on a website aren't
    really that relevant to the content or article.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. <strong>Accuracy</strong>: Your search will eventually, over time become
    inaccurate as so much content will be saved without being properly analyzed.
