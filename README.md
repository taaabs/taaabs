## About

Whatever topic you research, Taaabs is here to help. As you read or watch anything on the web, get AI assistance or just save it to your personal library. Advanced tagging system will help you find anything you've saved later.

Taaabs can also help you stay up to date with friends and like-minded people by following their recenlty created public bookmarks.

Perfect for students, professionals, and curious minds.

## Browser extension

Our extension is completely free and open-source. The same technology used to process pages for your personal library helps getting plain text of anything you consume straight (100% locally) to an AI assistant of your choice, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, you name it!

Supported sites:

- generic articles,
- youtube videos with transcripts,
- reddit posts,
- slack threads,
- gmail emails,
- x posts,
- telegram posts,
- github issues and discussions,
- conversations on popular chatbots, and more!

On unsupported sites, you can make a text selection and the extension will use it.

You can also send any image from a site (right click, then "Ask with image") to get help in a vision mode.

## Privacy

Taaabs is world's only bookmark manager that implements state-of-the-art encryption algorithms, no one, not even us can see what links you privately saved.

Private bookmarks are encrypted End-to-End with AES-CBC 256-bit, encryption key is derived with Argon2id. This mirrors [bitwarden's approach](https://bitwarden.com/help/what-encryption-is-used/). Complete source code of all our apps is public and anyone interested in inner-workings can learn from this repository.

## Who's behind it?

Designed and programmed by [Robert Piosik](https://x.com/robertpiosik), standing on the shoulders of giants. All the programming is done from a beautiful city of Poznan, Poland. Reach out when you come by!
